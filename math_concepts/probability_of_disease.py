Type of Question:
- math concept

Question:
A test indicating the presence of disease 
in cats 
is 95% accurate
in terms of both sensitivity and specificity. 

The prevalence of the disease is 3% 
which means only 3% of known cats have the disease. 

If your cat tests positive (negative) for the disease, 
what’s the probability that 
your cat has (doesn’t have) the disease?

Input:
- the accuracy of a test
- the percent of a population which has the diseas 

Clarifying Questions / Insights:
- sensitivity == specificity == accuracy
- You shouldn't use any libraries.
- automatically round output values to the 4th decimal.
	
- If I knew / had this....
	-

Output:
- given a positive test result,
what is the probability that an individual 
has the disease

- given a negative test result,
what is the probability that an individual 
does not have the disease
