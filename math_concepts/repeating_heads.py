Type of Question:
- math concept

Question:
- You’re considering a $100 bet with your friend. 
- If n consecutive fair coin flips 
result in all heads, then you win 
- else your friend wins. 
- Your friend agrees to let you attempt the bet 
as many times as you’d like. 
- Assuming you attempt the bet x times,
what's the probability that you’ll win the bet at least once? 
- As well, what should your winning payout ($100, $200, etc)
be to ensure that you at least break even 
given unlimited attempts of the bet?

Input:
- the number of consecutive coin flips (n)
- the number of bet attempts (x) 

Clarifying Questions / Insights:
- You can assume a fair coin.
- You shouldn't use any libraries.
- automatically round output values to the 4th decimal.
	
- If I knew / had this....
	-

Output:
- the probability that you win at least once
- your required winning payout
