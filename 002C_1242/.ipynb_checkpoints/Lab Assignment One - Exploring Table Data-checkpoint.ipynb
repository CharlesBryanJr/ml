    "    - The Census Income dataset includes 48,842 records with 14 features. It contains both categorical and continuous variables. It is targeted at individuals over 16 with an adjusted gross income over 100 and working hours, this dataset also contains missing values. The data focuses on a subset of the population most relevant for the study of income levels.\n",
    "- **Describe the purpose of the data set you selected (i.e., why and how was this data collected in the first place?).**\n",
    "    - I seleceted this dataset because I am interested in Socio-economic Analysis. Given this dataset provides a rich source of socio-economic information, it is ideal for examining income distribution and factors influencing economic status.\n",

    "- **What is the prediction task for your data and why are other third parties interested in the result**\n",
    "    - This dataset was collected to analyze and predict the income level of individuals based on various demographic and employment factors. The primary prediction task is to determine whether an individual earns more than $50,000 per year. Third parties, including government agencies, policymakers, and businesses, are interested in this dataset for shaping welfare programs, tax policies, studying market trends, and consumer behavior\n",
    "- **Once you begin modeling, how well would your prediction algorithm need to perform to be considered useful to these third parties? Be specific and use your own words to describe the aspects of the data.**\n",
    "    - For this prediction algorithm to be useful to third parties, it needs to achieve a high level of accuracy in classifying individuals into the correct income categories. Specific metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score should be considered. Also, model interpretability can add value for third parties seeking to understand the underlying factors influencing income levels."
